This project is focused on testing and exploring frameworks for name entity recognition in the legal domain.

Several possibilities exist, including usage of encoder frameworks such as BERT however these methods are now outdated.

Future development should include a unification of model testing, to compare different frameworks (both base and fine-tuned) in the same script.

SOTA method is likely LLM generative text fine tuned on sentence based annotated text (llama on legal_ner could be interesting)
